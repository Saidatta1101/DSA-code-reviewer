DSA Code Reviewer

DSA Code Reviewer is a full-stack web application that analyzes Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) code and evaluates its efficiency using machine learning and static code analysis. The system extracts structural features such as loop depth and algorithm patterns, including Dynamic Programming and Two Pointers, to classify solutions as efficient, suboptimal, or inefficient. It also provides insights such as algorithm efficiency classification, loop complexity, and code structure analytics through an interactive dashboard.

Overview
The DSA Code Reviewer is designed to help developers and students evaluate the quality and efficiency of their algorithm implementations. Users can submit their code solutions, which are then analyzed by a backend machine learning model.
Based on extracted code features, the model classifies the solution as efficient, suboptimal, or inefficient.
The platform also provides visual analytics and performance insights, allowing users to better understand their coding patterns and improve the efficiency of their algorithms.

Features
Code Analysis
The application accepts user-submitted DSA code and performs structural analysis. It extracts key features from the code, including:
Loop depth
Code patterns
Structural complexity
Machine Learning Based Evaluation
The backend machine learning model evaluates the extracted features and predicts the efficiency level of the submitted code.
Possible classifications include:
Efficient
Suboptimal
Inefficient

The model is trained on code features derived from algorithm implementations.

Analytics Dashboard
The platform provides an analytics dashboard that offers visual insights into analyzed code submissions. The dashboard includes:
Distribution of efficiency classifications
Analysis of algorithm usage patterns
Visual summaries of submitted solutions
